The _μ shell_ is a toy I made in a few hours to help with doing math/physics without pen and paper. However, the shell does not actually do math; it is just a structured text editor. Here's how it works:

1. run `npm run shell`
2. You will be dropped into a REPL with a `μ` prompt. From here, you can run commands by typing them and pressing enter, just like a shell. Send SIGINT (ctrl-c) to terminate a command or EOF (ctrl-d) to terminate the process.
3. Execute `h` to get a list of available commands.
4. There are some convenient unicode shortcuts (like \gamma for Greek γ).

My conclusion is that math is not meant to be done in a terminal.
